Symptoms of mushroom poisoning may vary from gastric upset to organ failure resulting in death.

Most "poisonous" mushrooms contain gastrointestinal irritants that cause vomiting and diarrhea (sometimes requiring hospitalization), but usually no long-term damage. However, there are a number of recognized mushroom toxins with specific, and sometimes deadly, effects:',
    'home_article_describe2': 'Cacti do most of their growing in the warmer seasons. Therefore, during the spring and summer, they need a deep soak to give them the supplemental moisture needed to support their growth. Water your cactus only when the soil is completely dry.

        'Generally, you should water a cactus in the morning. This way, the warmth of the day will help the soil dry, leaving no excess moisture by night time. If moisture stays too long it can promote unwanted bacteria to form.',
    'home_article_describe3': 'One of the most important things a potting soil needs to do is provide roots access to air by letting water drain away from them. In the ground, the soil is usually deep enough to let excess water drain beyond root zones. In pots, however, water tends to accumulate at the bottom, despite drainage holes. The smaller the pore spaces of the soil in the pot, the higher that water layer will reach. Larger pores, formed by adding mineral aggregates to potting soils, readily admit water into the soil, then carry it through the medium and out the bottom. Then all those large, empty spaces can fill with air.',
